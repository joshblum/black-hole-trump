Black Hole Trump
================

Won’t you come and install Black Hole Trump? Any appearance of the name
"President Trump" triggers the 1994 SOUNDGARDEN hit song "Black Hole Sun" to
play in its entirety*. All 5 minutes and 19 seconds will remind you that, over
the next four years, an implosion is going to play out that is just so huge.
It’ll really knock your socks off, folks. Tremendous things. Big league.

But, where hides the face and lies the snake, there is sun in our disgrace;
we’ve included a link to [donate to the
ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/donate-to-aclu.)\*\*.  Heaven can send hell
away. And you can help.

\* We don’t claim copyright to "Black Hole Sun" and are in no way affiliated
  with SOUNDGARDEN (please don’t be mad at us).
  
\*\* We are also in no way affiliated with the ACLU.
